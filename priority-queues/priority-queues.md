## Priority Queues

- A data structure where each element has a priority

- Elements with higher priorities are served before elements with lower priorities

- A priority queue is an abstract concept and can be implemented using a data structure other than Binary Heaps

### Representing Priority Queues

**Using Classes**

- PriorityQueue
    - `values: []`

- Node
    - `value`
    - `priority`

## Common methods

For implementation refer corresponding methods in Binary Heaps

### `enqueue`

### `dequeue`
